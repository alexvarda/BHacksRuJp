The unfortunate truth is that advertising is pretty much the only way to pay for content on the web right now. Despite that many people share the view that there are no "good" ads. Those people prefer to not see any ads at all and use ad blocking browser extensions.

The problem is that the blank space taken up by the blocked ads remains unused. Our project seeks to make use of this blank space by replacing it with useful content. We will build a browser extension that will replace adds with the most breaking news from custom chosen newspapers.  

We called our extension NewsBlock.
